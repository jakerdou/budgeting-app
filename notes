make uncategorized the default filter by category, make it so that the distinction between all and uncategorized isn't actual null and a string "null"
be able to change transaction dates
maybe look into only using one confirmation modal in index.tsx
put search bar in transactions page, will need to do this in backend because of pagination it won't search all the transactions. they aren't all loaded in the frontend
add today button next to date picker that will take you to teh range of dates that includes today
put more transaction info in the transaction info modal, will need to save in db like just more descriptive fields. theres a problem with some of the transaction names not being descriptive enough e.g. 'aplpay store'
create new table CategoryGroup? to be able to group categories so that they show up grouped in the frontend

CODE DUPLICATION TO FIX:
    â€¢ create useModal() hook - modal state management pattern repeated everywhere

allocating at times can reduce income from this period number on screen

add splitting transaction amount to different categories
add note about no categories if there aren't any

less important

    make it so that users can't sign up if the create-user endpoint returns an error

    move db.py to backend db folder

    there's an issue with plaid link on ios, look at homepage file from tiny quickstart and compare them to see if there's any issue

    right now we get categories in the frontend in the categories provider, then we call the endpoint to get allocated backend endpoint and then pair them in the frontend, maybe just get categories as a whole form the backend, idk

    add color stylings

    handle case where start date is after current date

    rename top level api folder
