to make mvp:
    make ui a bit better
        2 - create wireframes
        3 - enact change >:)

    implement pagination for transactions


less important
    go through index.tsx and datepickers and rename variables maybe to make it less confusing, different things are called budget period and pay period

    make it so that users can't sign up if the create-user endpoint returns an error

    move db.py to backend db folder

    there's an issue with plaid link on ios, look at homepage file from tiny quickstart and compare them to see if there's any issue

    right now we get categories in the frontend in the categories provider, then we call the endpoint to get allocated backend endpoint and then pair them in the frontend, maybe just get categories as a whole form the backend, idk

    maybe make frontend display amount of unallocated funds you have from the current budget period (basically the sum of the transactions assigned to unallocated funds category for that period of time)

    make add transaction button a plus icon

    add color stylings

    handle case where start date is after current date

    rename top level api folder

    show no transactions message when there are none
