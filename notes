Fixes:
    make budget period change when dropdown is changed on budget page

to make mvp:
    maybe forget plaid and use pnc and amex APIs
        https://developer.pnc.com/documentation/products/Information-Reporting/4/overview?linkRef=documentation

    fix change transaction category on ios

    make monthly next and previous function correctly

    be able to delete categories when no transactions correspond to them

    integrate with plaid
    add fetch transactions button that will fetch from plaid

    add account object to db and methods to fetch/create

    add endpoint to call after successfully linking bank accounts through plaid that will:
        save account id, name, user id and stuff to account object
        save public token to user object
    if user has public token, make a call to fetch their transactions when the app is opened maybe, look into how to do this, maybe have fetch transactions button

    add place in app to unlink accounts and remove them from db

    update object diagram in draw.io that will show the variables necessary for the account object and the updates to the user object (just public key I think)


    there's an issue with plaid link on ios, look at homepage file from tiny quickstart and compare them to see if there's any issue


less important
    go through index.tsx and datepickers and rename variables maybe to make it less confusing, different things are called budtet period and pay period

    maybe make frontend display amount of unallocated funds you have from the current budget period (basically the sum of the transactions assigned to unallocated funds category for that period of time)

    figure out why categories sometimes comes back empty

    make add transaction button a plus icon

    add color stylings

    have unified format date function

    handle case where start date is after current date

    make transaction category a dropdown button that changes the category

    make times consistent across app and database
        put timezone in user preferences

        save as midnight local time (according to user.preferences.time_zone)
            pay period start date
            manually added transaction date

        display as local time
            date pickers in budget page
            date in transaction page
            start date in preferences page

        make sure that set start/end date and set next/prev start/end date functions are all using timezone user preference

        rename top level api folder

        get monthly budget period preference to work, budget period dropdown is messed up when budget period is monthly and pay_schedule is null or when we go from bi-weekly to monthly in budget period preferences and go back to budget page
